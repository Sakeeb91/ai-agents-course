# AI Agents Course - Complete Project

> A comprehensive AI agent chat application built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, featuring multiple deployment options and beautiful custom UIs.

**Live Demo**: [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sakeeb/ai-multi-agent-chat)

## Introduction

This repository contains my complete journey through the **Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Course**, where I learned to build intelligent AI agents that can think, act, and respond autonomously. Here, I'm sharing everything I've learned along with my project implementations, from simple single-agent systems to complex multi-agent architectures.

The course covers foundational concepts of AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. I've built multiple applications showcasing different agent patterns and deployment strategies, making AI agents accessible through beautiful web interfaces.

## Project Features

- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Flask web app, Gradio interface, and Hugging Face Spaces
- **Beautiful UI**: Orange-mauve gradient theme with glassmorphism effects
- **Rich Markdown Support**: Code highlighting, tables, lists, and more
- **Multi-Agent Architectures**: LLM orchestration, Sequential, and Parallel workflows
- **Production Ready**: Deployed and live on Hugging Face

## Applications

1. **Flask Web Chat** - Custom web interface (`web-chat/`)
2. **Gradio App** - Production Gradio interface (`app.py`)
3. **Multi-Agent App** - Advanced multi-agent demo (`app_multiagent.py`)
